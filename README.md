- 👋 Hi, I’m @Olsion Bejleri
- 👀 I’m interested in building scalable web applications, backend development with Java, and solving complex problems using Python and computer science principles.
- 🌱 I’m currently deepening my knowledge in data structures, algorithms, and system design through Harvard's CS50 course, and expanding my skills in Spring Boot and REST APIs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, innovative tech solutions, and developer communities that focus on Java or Python-based technologies.
